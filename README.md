week1 homework reflection

What requirements did you acheive?

I felt as though I acheived the requirements of building out the webpage.
I included the relative sections of the webpage <header> <nav> <main> <section> <div> <body> <main> <footer>
I used a flex box to position and space my navigation links in the header where they were fixed whilst scrolling.
Using sections I split the webpage into three different sections where I placed an image as the background from my local folder /
I then used relative positioning on the images and absolute positioning on the text and the appropriate stylings in css to lay the text over the image.

Where there any requirements or goals that you didn't acheive?

As you can see I wasn't able to complete the stretch goals. Which I would of really like to have completed.
Unfortunatley as I had missed a day I had to catch up on work and I thought best to stick with what needed doing then to burn myself out and get stressed out over stuff that I would eventually learn.
I would rather take my time learning them so I can really understand them.

Optional

Whilst laying out my webpage I had trouble with dissapearing text, after a quick Google search I quickly learnt about the Z-INDEX and got my text back to where it should be.

I learnt a lot about workflow in this exercise, especially having missed a day. I found it really useful to work in stages, which I found worked really well with pushing to git.
I started off with a very rough layout, sections.
Then adding a very rough guide as to what was going in these sections.
Then I worked on positioning of the navigational menu bar.
Which I then added in content, correct titles and positioning these as I went along.
After each of these process' I updated the git files and added appropirate comments.

As far as requesting feedback about a certain parts of my submission, as I missed the day where you covered the flexbox and absolute/relative positioning. I would find it very useful to have that looked out, just to check I have done both things correctly.
I feel as though I have with the flexbox, but there were certain things with positioning the text over the image that I wasn't sure whether they were working correctly.
For example when I had that text appearing absolute to the image, it seemed like they weren't where they should be so I was moving them over a lot to get to where they needed to be.

I found myself getting confused when creating the divs (where my text would be) as to what I could include in a div, and then how I could seperate these within a div to then style certain elements, if that makes sense?
